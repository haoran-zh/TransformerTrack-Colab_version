The code is based on the paper: **Transformer Meets Tracker: Exploiting Temporal Context for Robust Visual Tracking**[[Paper Link]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.11681.pdf). 

The latest Pytorch no longer supports the original code provided by the authors. 
I modified their code to make it feasible on Colab and Pytorch 2.0.
